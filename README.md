Project: RISC 

Software Tools: Vivado and Verilog programming language.

Design Specifications:

    Designed a complete RISC pipeline CPU in Verilog programming language.

    Used modular code approach to create separate modules for each execution stage, such as register read and write, data memory read and write, instruction fetch, decode, execution, and write back to register.  

    RISC CPU is designed to execute all the instructions mentioned in the list adjacent to this information.

Simulation:

    Each instruction in the list is added to the instruction set with corresponding data, address, loop conditions, and address to the instruction memory of the RISC CPU.

    All the instructions are run sequentially, resembling actual CPU operations with straightforward synchronization between sequences of operations in real time. 

    Every instruction behavior is recorded to report fetch, decode, and execution time frames. Also, corresponding memory addresses, registers, write-back values, and the data used for operations are analyzed and reported. 

    All the modules and instructions are tested for boundary conditions and worst-case values.
